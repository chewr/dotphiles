- The work/personal toggle in git config should not be in committed code. The default in committed code should be personal
- There are a number of setup steps which should be performed on new machines

	- Set up SSH keys + prompt user to upload to github
	- populate `deploy/packages` with useful packages to install via package managers
- Wildcard for hosts in dotsyncrc would be nice so we don't have to manually enter that each time
